# hello-world

This repository contains the projects from my studio classes last year. The main projects are:

- **dog.js**: A JavaScript program that (A function to convert human years to dog years based on common pet age conversion rules.).
- **monsters.js**: A JavaScript project (The game where the player fights randomly selected monsters, earning points for wins and resetting on losses).
- **game-girl.html, CSS,j.s**: A simple game girl that ( A basic drawing game where users can draw on a grid-based canvas using mouse events.)

## Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Reflection:
While working on these projects, I developed a function to convert human years into dog years, considering different age ranges. Some challenges with this function included ensuring the proper handling of edge cases, such as negative or zero values, but I resolved these by incorporating validation checks. 

I learned how to implement a simple combat game in JavaScript using classes and user input. I faced challenges handling the game loop and managing the random selection of enemies. Still, I overcame them by using a clear structure for the game logic and careful debugging.

I am learning how to create an interactive drawing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which involves handling mouse events and manipulating the canvas element.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
- I could add user input functionality to make the program interactive, allowing users to enter the number of human years to calculate the corresponding dog years.
- I could add a feature where players can choose to upgrade their stats (e.g., health or attack) after defeating a monster, adding more depth and strategy to the gameplay.
- I could add a timer to limit the drawing time and reset the canvas when time runs out.
